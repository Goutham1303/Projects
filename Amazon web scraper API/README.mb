AMAZON WEB SCRAPER API

Web Scraping and Data Extraction:
Used requests to fetch the webpage content and BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML.
Extracted the product title and price from the Amazon page using the product's HTML IDs.
Cleaned the extracted data by stripping unnecessary characters.

Data Storage and Logging:
Stored the extracted data (title, price, and date) in a CSV file.
Used csv and pandas to handle data storage and retrieval.
Implemented a function to periodically check the product price and append new data to the CSV file.

Automated Notifications:
Set up an SMTP connection to send email alerts when the product price drops below a certain threshold.
Used a while loop with a sleep interval to automate the price checking process and keep the dataset updated.
